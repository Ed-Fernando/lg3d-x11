Building the lg3d-x11.tar.gz bundle
-----------------------------------

This directory contains the lg3d-x11-build script which creates
a gzipped tar bundle which can be installed in the lg3d-x11 CVS
workspace. This directory also contains an auxilliary script 
lg3d-x11-install which is invoked by lg3d-x11-build.

1. First, you need to check out a copy of the Xorg monolithic server
   branch lg3d-dev. Let $XORGDIR be the parent xc directory of this
   copy.

2. Next, you need to build the X server

   % cd $XORGDIR
   % make World

3. Next, make sure you are in $XORGDIR and then type
   lg3d-x11-build <dir>. (<dir> is the directory in which
   the bundle will be installed). For example:

   % cd $XORGDIR
   % lg3d-x11/scripts/lg3d-x11-build /tmp/myx11builds

   You will be asked to provide the version number of
   the bundle. The version number usually starts with 'dev'
   if it is an interim development bundle or 'release' if
   it the bundle is for an official LG release. Next comes
   the release version number (e.g. 0-8-0) and then the 
   build number (e.g. -6). For example:
   
   Creating VERSION file.
   Please enter the version identifier (e.g. release-x-y-z) followed by ENTER and ^D
   > dev-0-8-0-6
   ^D

   IMPORTANT: you must type Control-D after hitting ENTER!

At this point the bundle will be built and installed in the
directory <dir>/$os/$arch, where $os is the the O.S. you are
of the machine you built on and $arch is the architecture.

The bundle will be named as follows:

lg3d-x11-<os>-<arch>-<version>.tar.gz

(e.g. lg3d-x11-solaris-i86pc-dev-0-8-0-8.tar.gz)


Integrating the bundle in the lg3d-x11 CVS
------------------------------------------

1. Check out the lg3d-x11 CVS head. 

2. cd $os/$arch

3. rm lg3d-x11.tar.gz

4. Copy the bundle from where it was installed in the
   previous step into this directory, renaming it 
   lg3d-x11.tar.gz in the process.

5. Make sure that the <interfaceProvided> element in 
   the version.xml in this directory correctly reflects
   the LGE interface version numbers (<major>.<minor>) 
   of the bundle you are installing.

At this point you can do a commit to integrate your 
changes into the CVS.
