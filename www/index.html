<h2>Welcome to Project Looking Glass X11 Build Repository!<br>
</h2>
<p>
lg3d-x11 is a sub-project of the java.net lg3d project. It contains
pre-packaged distributions of the LG X11 servers. These distributions
(aka builds) are contained in the cvs tree of this sub-project. The lg3d-x11 X distribution is a version of the X.org X11R6.8.2 release which has been modified for use with LG3D.
<p>
<b>For documentation on the LG modifications to the Xorg server, refer to 
<a href="http://xorg.freedesktop.org/wiki/LookingGlassIntegration">
http://xorg.freedesktop.org/wiki/LookingGlassIntegration</a></b>.
<p>
For every branch of the lg3d-core cvs there is a corresponding branch
of the lg3d-x11 cvs with the same name. For example, for the dev
branch of lg3d-core cvs there is an lg3d-x11 cvs branch named lg3d-dev.
<p>
HISTORICAL NOTE: The X11 builds used to be stored in the lg3d-core cvs itself.
With the addition of Solaris x86 support and app mode the size of the build
started to get to large to keep in lg3d-core. Also, many developers use only dev
mode to run LG and this mode doesn't require X11 at all. So it didn't make 
sense to force people to download bits that they weren't using.
<p>
<b>TO BUILD LG3D-CORE WITHOUT X11 SUPPORT:</b>
<p>
In order to build lg3d-core without X11 support all you need to do is 
check out the lg3d-core and lg3d-demo-apps cvs trees, go into lg3d-core
and type 'ant'. There is no need to have a copy of the lg3d-x11 cvs present.
<p>
With this type of build, you will be able to run lg3d-dev. But if you 
try to run lg3d-session or lg3d-app, an error message will be generated
because X11 support will not be available.
<p>
<b>TO BUILD LG3D-CORE WITH X11 SUPPORT:</b>
<p>
In order to build lg3d-core with X11 support, not only do you need
to check out the lg3d-core and lg3d-demo-apps cvs trees, but you
also need to check out the corresponding branch of the lg3d-x11 cvs tree.
lg3d-x11 must be a sibling directory of lg3d-core.
<p>
To check out builds for all supported platforms:
<p>
<blockquote><span
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
cvs checkout -r <i>branch-name</i> lg3d-x11
</span></blockquote>
<p>
To only check out the build for specific platform:
<p>
<blockquote><span
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
cvs checkout -r <i>branch-name</i> lg3d-x11/<i>platform</i>/<i>arch</i>
</span></blockquote>
<p>
The currently supported values of <span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;"><i>platform</i>/<i>arch</i></span> are:
<blockquote><span
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
    linux/i686 
<br>
    linux/x86_64</span> (AMD64)
<br><span
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
    solaris/i86pc</span> (for Solaris x86).
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>TO ACCESS THE LG X11 SOURCE:</b>
<p>
The LG X11 is available in a branch of the X.org cvs trunk on 
freedesktop.org (http://freedesktop.org/Software/xorg). The master branch name 
is 'lg3d'. At the time of this writing, the current development branch is lg3d-dev
For information on how to get access 
to the X.org cvs tree, refer to http://freedesktop.org/XOrg/CvsPage.</b>
<p>
If you don't plan to make modifications to the source, you can check out
a copy of the source tree in anonymous mode by doing the following:
<p>
<blockquote><span
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
cvs -d:pserver:anoncvs@pdx.freedesktop.org:/cvs co -r lg3d-dev xc 
</span></blockquote>
<p>
If you wish to be able to make modifications to the source, you 
will need to check out a copy of the tree in developer mode. 
To do this, you will need to register as an Xorg freedesktop
developer. Instructions are provided in http://www.freedesktop.org/Main/UsingCvs,
in the section "Using developer CVS".
<p>
Caveat: I found that I needed to make some modifications to these developer
instructions. Here is what worked for me:
<p>
<blockquote><span
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
% setenv CVS_RSH /usr/bin/ssh
<br>
% setenv CVSROOT :ext:<i>my-user-name</i>@pdx.freedesktop.org:/cvs/xorg
<br>
</span></blockquote>
(Note: it's pdx. not cvs. as described on the web page)
<p>
<b>NOTE: This project does not currently have its own issues list.
Instead, please use the "X11 integration" subcomponent
in the <a href="https://lg3d-core.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectIssues">Issue
Tracker</a> of the lg3d-core project. If you encounter any
issues with lg3d-x11,
please file them there.</b>
</p>
<b>DEVELOPER CONVENTIONS:</b>
<p>
Here are some conventions developers should follow when integrating
new bits into this cvs:
<ol>
<li>Whenever you make a change to the x11 source code, be sure to increment
the value of the variable lgeint.h:LG3D_IMPLEMENTATION by 1. This is a client-visible
variable which distinguishes unique builds of LG X11.</li>
<br>
<li>When you integrate code into the Xorg CVS or into the lg3d-x11 cvs, be sure
to include the major and minor interface numbers in the CVS comment if either number
has changed. These numbers are defined in xc/include/extensions/lgewire.h.
</ol>
<b>CONCLUSION:</b>
<p>
Thanks for your interest in the project and spending your time reading
this.&nbsp;
We hope you will join our project and explore this fun opportunity
with us.
